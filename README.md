Motivation
==========

Idea for creating this somewhat 'unique', depending on how you see it, live wallpaper came
from the need for giving a person similarly unique birthday present she deserved.
In order to achieve anything meeting the standards I've been after, even distinctly,
this wallpaper was created by combining two rather different sources;

1. TV series [The Love Boat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Love_Boat), which aired early 80s.
2. Video created by Junji Kojima for song
[Yoshinori Sunahara - Lovebeat](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbyuUvoklBY).

Quite obviously, Lovebeat, the video and the song name, resembles much more into
this wallpaper in many ways. But reason for mentioning The Love Boat TV series
is for hopes some of the mood on the show had been transferred into this
wallpaper too. You'll be the judge if it did or didn't

You can find precompiled application from Google Play market where latest
version of the wallpaper ought to be published every now and then.
If there are changes worth publishing that is;
