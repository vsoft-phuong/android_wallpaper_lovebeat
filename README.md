Motivation
==========

Idea for creating this somewhat 'unique', depending on how you see it, live wallpaper came
from the need for giving a person similarly unique birthday present she deserved.
In order to achieve anything meeting the standards I've been after, even distinctly,
this wallpaper was created by combining two rather different sources;

1. TV series [The Love Boat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Love_Boat), which aired early 80s.
2. Video created by Junji Kojima for song
[Yoshinori Sunahara - Lovebeat](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbyuUvoklBY).

Quite obviously, Lovebeat, the video and the song name, resembles much more into
this wallpaper in many ways. But reason for mentioning The Love Boat TV series
is for hopes some of the mood on the show had been transferred too into this
wallpaper.

Once ready this wallpaper will be published on Android Market. But right now
source code only has to do.
